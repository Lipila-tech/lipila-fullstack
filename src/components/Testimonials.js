                        Lipila has made it so much easier for me to pay my child's school
                        fees. I can now pay online with my credit card, and it's done in
                        minutes. I highly recommend Lipila to all parents.

                        Lipila has been a lifesaver for me. I used to have to drive to the
                        bank to pay my child's school fees, which was a huge hassle. Now, I
                        can pay online with my mobile money, and it's so much easier.
